                      Wealth Management. You have goals for your future;
                      probably more than one. They might be about the lifestyle
                      you hope to lead in retirement. Or a child's education.
                      There might be a charitable cause you hope to support more
                      fully, or a hobby you've yearned to pursue. Or perhaps
                      you're just not quite able to articulate your goal. But we
                      bet you have one, nevertheless. Understanding what's
                      really important to you is at the heart of how we'll begin
                      to build the kind of relationship you expect. Step by
                      step, in a way that is very personal, very open and very
                      focused on your hopes and dreams and goals. Wealth
                      management is very straightforward. From the affluent
                      individual’s perspective, wealth management is simply the
                      science of solving/enhancing his or her financial
                      situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective,
                      wealth management is the ability of an advisor or advisory
                      team to deliver a full range of financial services and
                      products to an affluent client in a consultative way.
                      Theoretically, a wealth manager can provide every single
                      financial product in existence. In reality most wealth
                      managers specialize in services and products they feel
                      most comfortable with...

                      Retirement & College Savings. You’re cruising along at
                      35,000 feet when the cabin suddenly losses pressure.
                      Yellow oxygen masks deploy from the ceiling, begging to be
                      used. You start reaching for the lifeline but your child
                      sitting next to you screams for help. What’s your next
                      move? If you follow the preflight safety instructions, you
                      put on your own mask before assisting others, no questions
                      asked. After all, it’s difficult to help others if you
                      don’t help yourself first. This seems straightforward when
                      we’re flying through the sky, but a recent report from T.
                      Rowe Price reveals that it becomes cloudy when we’re on
                      the ground, handling money, as an alarming number of
                      parents are putting their own retirements at risk in order
                      to fund their children’s college expenses. Nine out of 10
                      parents believe their children will attend college, and
                      since college typically arrives before retirement, the
                      majority of parents feel like they should put money toward
                      that first and save for retirement after. In fact, 49% of
                      parents are willing to delay their own retirements to pay
                      for their children’s education, while 74% feel guilty they
                      won’t be able to provide more financial assistance.
                      Overall, 63% are concerned about their children having
                      enough financial resources to attend...

                      Insurance & Annuities. Annuities are financial tools that
                      can be used for receiving potential guaranteed income in
                      retirement. Various types of annuities let you choose
                      which benefits matter most and how often you are paid. All
                      are tax-friendly, meaning you don't pay taxes on them
                      until you receive your annuity or income payments, which
                      are usually when you're in retirement and could be taxed
                      at a lower rate. Allstate offers a variety of solutions
                      from leading financial service providers, so you have many
                      options when deciding what type of annuity is right for
                      you. How Annuities Work: Learning more about annuities can
                      help you understand what options are available to you. An
                      Allstate personal financial representative can answers
                      questions you have about the following features:Lasting
                      income: An annuity is a contract between you and an
                      insurance company. They invest your money and provide a
                      regular source of income that you can receive a paycheck
                      for life, depending on the contract selections you make.
                      Tax advantages: Your earnings are not taxed until
                      withdrawn. This means that when you typically start
                      receiving your annuity or income payments, they could be
                      taxed at a lower rate, making annuities an attractive
                      savings option...

                      Cash & Credit. In my investment advisory programs, you
                      generally pay an asset based fee, charged quarterly in
                      advance, based on the total value of the assets in your
                      account at the end of the previous quarter. Unless
                      otherwise noted, the asset-based fee generally covers
                      investment consulting and certain brokerage services
                      provided by FinAdvision, as well as the external or
                      internal investment management fees. However, the
                      asset-based fee does not cover expenses paid within any
                      exchange-traded funds or mutual funds you may own. You may
                      select from our comprehensive suite of managed account
                      programs, which are designed for various levels of
                      investment experience and sophistication, with asset
                      minimums that start as low as $5,000. Depending upon the
                      program, your investment advisory account may include
                      stocks, bonds, money market funds, mutual funds,
                      exchange-traded funds and cash. You can establish
                      investment advisory relationships for your retirement or
                      trust accounts in addition to your personal investment

                      Stocks, Bonds & Mutual Funds. Fresh off Wall Street's
                      worst week in four years – one that saw the Dow Jones
                      industrial average lose 10 percent of its value and the
                      Standard & Poor's 500 index slip below the magical 2,000
                      barrier – I have two words of advice for gun-shy
                      investors. Don't panic. "We're starting to get some calls,
                      as should be expected," says Erik Jensen, president and

                      the market's softening became a full-blown meltdown

                      Wealth Management. You have goals for your future;
                      probably more than one. They might be about the lifestyle
                      you hope to lead in retirement. Or a child's education.
                      There might be a charitable cause you hope to support more
                      fully, or a hobby you've yearned to pursue. Or perhaps
                      you're just not quite able to articulate your goal. But we
                      bet you have one, nevertheless. Understanding what's
                      really important to you is at the heart of how we'll begin
                      to build the kind of relationship you expect. Step by
                      step, in a way that is very personal, very open and very
                      focused on your hopes and dreams and goals. Wealth
                      management is very straightforward. From the affluent
                      individual’s perspective, wealth management is simply the
                      science of solving/enhancing his or her financial
                      situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective,
                      wealth management is the ability of an advisor or advisory
                      team to deliver a full range of financial services and
                      products to an affluent client in a consultative way.
                      Theoretically, a wealth manager can provide every single
                      financial product in existence. In reality most wealth

                      Insurance & Annuities. Annuities are financial tools that
                      can be used for receiving potential guaranteed income in
                      retirement. Various types of annuities let you choose
                      which benefits matter most and how often you are paid. All
                      are tax-friendly, meaning you don't pay taxes on them
                      until you receive your annuity or income payments, which
                      are usually when you're in retirement and could be taxed
                      at a lower rate. Allstate offers a variety of solutions
                      from leading financial service providers, so you have many

                      income: An annuity is a contract between you and an
                      insurance company. They invest your money and provide a
                      regular source of income that you can receive a paycheck
                      for life, depending on the contract selections you make.
                      Tax advantages: Your earnings are not taxed until
                      withdrawn. This means that when you typically start
                      receiving your annuity or income payments, they could be
                      taxed at a lower rate, making annuities an attractive

                      Wealth Management. You have goals for your future;
                      probably more than one. They might be about the lifestyle
                      you hope to lead in retirement. Or a child's education.
                      There might be a charitable cause you hope to support more
                      fully, or a hobby you've yearned to pursue. Or perhaps
                      you're just not quite able to articulate your goal. But we
                      bet you have one, nevertheless. Understanding what's
                      really important to you is at the heart of how we'll begin
                      to build the kind of relationship you expect. Step by
                      step, in a way that is very personal, very open and very
                      focused on your hopes and dreams and goals. Wealth
                      management is very straightforward. From the affluent
                      individual’s perspective, wealth management is simply the
                      science of solving/enhancing his or her financial
                      situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective,
                      wealth management is the ability of an advisor or advisory
                      team to deliver a full range of financial services and
                      products to an affluent client in a consultative way.
                      Theoretically, a wealth manager can provide every single
                      financial product in existence. In reality most wealth
                      managers specialize in services and products they feel

                      Retirement & College Savings. You’re cruising along at
                      35,000 feet when the cabin suddenly losses pressure.
                      Yellow oxygen masks deploy from the ceiling, begging to be
                      used. You start reaching for the lifeline but your child
                      sitting next to you screams for help. What’s your next
                      move? If you follow the preflight safety instructions, you
                      put on your own mask before assisting others, no questions
                      asked. After all, it’s difficult to help others if you
                      don’t help yourself first. This seems straightforward when
                      we’re flying through the sky, but a recent report from T.

                      parents are putting their own retirements at risk in order

                      parents believe their children will attend college, and
                      since college typically arrives before retirement, the
                      majority of parents feel like they should put money toward
                      that first and save for retirement after. In fact, 49% of
                      parents are willing to delay their own retirements to pay
                      for their children’s education, while 74% feel guilty they
                      won’t be able to provide more financial assistance.
                      Overall, 63% are concerned about their children having

                      Insurance & Annuities. Annuities are financial tools that
                      can be used for receiving potential guaranteed income in
                      retirement. Various types of annuities let you choose
                      which benefits matter most and how often you are paid. All
                      are tax-friendly, meaning you don't pay taxes on them
                      until you receive your annuity or income payments, which
                      are usually when you're in retirement and could be taxed
                      at a lower rate. Allstate offers a variety of solutions
                      from leading financial service providers, so you have many
                      options when deciding what type of annuity is right for
                      you. How Annuities Work: Learning more about annuities can
                      help you understand what options are available to you. An
